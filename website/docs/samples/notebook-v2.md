# Notebook sample

This sample shows how Mesh for Data enables a Jupyter notebook workload to access a dataset.
It demonstrates how policies are seamlessly applied when accessing the dataset. 

## Before you begin

- Install Mesh for Data using the [Quick Start](../get-started/quickstart-v2.md) guide.
  This sample assumes the use of the built-in catalog, Open Policy Agent (OPA) and flight module.
- A web browser.

## Create a namespace for the sample

Create a new Kubernetes namespace and set it as the active namespace:

```bash
kubectl create namespace m4d-notebook-sample
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=m4d-notebook-sample
```

This enables easy [cleanup](#cleanup) once you're done experimenting with the sample.

## Prepare a dataset to be accessed by the notebook

This sample uses the [Synthetic Financial Datasets For Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/paysim1/data) dataset[^1] as the data that the notebook needs to read. Download and extract the file to your machine. You should now see a file named `PS_20174392719_1491204439457_log.csv`. Alternatively, you may download [`data.csv`](https://github.com/ibm/the-mesh-for-data/blob/master/samples/kubeflow/data.csv) which includes just the first 100 lines of this dataset.

[^1]: Created by NTNU and shared under the ***CC BY-SA 4.0*** license.

Upload the CSV file to an object storage of your choice such as AWS S3, IBM Cloud Object Storage or Ceph.
Make a note of the service endpoint, bucket name, and access credentials. You will need them later.

??? tip "Setup and upload to MinIO"
    For experimentation you can install MinIO to your cluster instead of using a cloud service.
    
    1. Install Minio to the currently active namespace:
      ```bash
      helm repo add minio https://helm.min.io
      helm install --wait minio minio/minio
      ```
    1. Create a port-forward to connect to MinIO UI:
      ```bash
      kubectl port-forward svc/minio 9000 &
      ```
    1. Open [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) and login with the printed access key and secret key:
      ```
      ACCESS_KEY=$(kubectl get secret minio -o jsonpath="{.data.accesskey}" | base64 --decode)
      SECRET_KEY=$(kubectl get secret minio -o jsonpath="{.data.secretkey}" | base64 --decode)
      echo "Access Key: ${ACCESS_KEY}"
      echo "Secret Key: ${SECRET_KEY}"
      ```
    1. Click the :fontawesome-solid-plus-circle: button in the bottom right corner and then **Create bucket** to create a bucket (e.g. "demo").
    1. Click the :fontawesome-solid-plus-circle: button again and then **Upload files** to upload the CSV file to the newly created bucket.
    
## Register the dataset in a data catalog

<!-- TODO: there is a bug in the credentials connector that requires the secret name to match the asset name -->
Register the credentials required for accessing the dataset. Replace the values for `accessKey` and `secretKey` with the values from the object storage service that you used and run:

```yaml
cat << EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: data-csv
type: Opaque
stringData:
  accessKey: "${ACCESS_KEY}"
  secretKey: "${SECRET_KEY}"
EOF
```

Then, register the data asset itself in the catalog. Replace the values for `endpoint`, `bucket` and `objectKey` with values from the object storage service that you used and run:

```yaml
cat << EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: katalog.m4d.ibm.com/v1alpha1
kind: Asset
metadata:
  name: data-csv
spec:
  secretRef: 
    name: data-csv
  assetDetails:
    dataFormat: csv
    connection:
      type: s3
      s3:
        endpoint: "http://minio:9000"
        bucket: "demo"
        objectKey: "data.csv"
  assetMetadata:
    geography: us-south
    tags:
    - finance
    componentsMetadata:
      nameOrig: 
        tags:
        - PII
      oldbalanceOrg:
        tags:
        - sensitive
      newbalanceOrig:
        tags:
        - sensitive
EOF
```

The asset is now registered in the catalog. The identifier of the asset is `m4d-notebook-sample/data-csv` (i.e. `<namespace>/<name>`). You will use that name in the `M4DApplication` later.

Notice the `assetMetadata` field above. It specifies the dataset geography and tags. These attributes are later used in policies.


## Define data access policies

Currently predefined policies are included as part of the OPA deployment.
Included are policies that are triggered for datasets that are tagged with 'finance' and have columns `nameOrig` and `nameDest`. The policies indicate that these columns must be redacted (masked) when data is read.

The policies can be found at `third_party/opa/opa-policy.rego`.

## Deploy a Jupyter notebook

In this sample a Jupyter notebook is used as the user workload and its business logic requires reading the asset that we registered (e.g., for creating a fraud detection model). Deploy a notebook to your cluster:

=== "JupyterLab"
    1. Deploy JupyterLab:
        ```bash
        kubectl create deployment my-notebook --image=jupyter/base-notebook --port=8888 -- start.sh jupyter lab --LabApp.token=''
        kubectl set env deployment my-notebook JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB=yes
        kubectl label deployment my-notebook app.kubernetes.io/name=my-notebook
        kubectl expose deployment my-notebook --port=80 --target-port=8888
        ```
    1. Create a port-forward to communicate with JupyterLab:
        ```bash
        kubectl port-forward svc/my-notebook 8080:80 &
        ```
    1. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).
    1. Create a new notebook in the server


=== "Kubeflow"
    1. Ensure that [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/) is installed in your cluster
    1. Create a port-forward to communicate with Kubeflow:
        ```bash
        kubectl port-forward svc/istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system 8080:80 &
        ```
    1. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).
    1. Click **Start Setup** and then **Finish** (use the `anonymous` namespace).
    1. Click **Notebook Servers** (in the left).
    1. In the notebooks page select in the top left the `anonymous` namespace and then click **New Server**.
    1. In the notebook server creation page, set `my-notebook` in the **Name** box and then click **Launch**. Wait for the server to become ready.
    1. Click **Connect** and create a new notebook in the server.


## Create a `M4DApplication` resource for the notebook


Create a [`M4DApplication`](../reference/crds.md/#m4dapplication) resource to register the notebook workload to the control plane of Mesh for Data: 

<!-- TODO: role field removed but code still requires it -->
```yaml
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: app.m4d.ibm.com/v1alpha1
kind: M4DApplication
metadata:
  name: my-notebook
  labels:
    app: my-notebook
spec:
  selector:
    workloadSelector:
      matchLabels:
        app: my-notebook
  appInfo:
    purpose: fraud-detection
  data:
    - dataSetID: "m4d-notebook-sample/data-csv"
      requirements:
        interface: 
          protocol: m4d-arrow-flight
          dataformat: arrow
EOF
```

Notice that:

* The `selector` field match the labels of our Jupyter notebook workload.
* The `data` field includes a `dataSetID` that matches the asset identifier in the catalog.
* The `protocol` and `dataformat` indicate that the developer wants to consume the data using Apache Arrow Flight.

Wait util the `M4DApplication` is ready:
```bash
while [[ $(kubectl get m4dapplication my-notebook -o 'jsonpath={.status.ready}') != "True" ]]; do echo "waiting" && sleep 1; done
```

## Read the dataset from the notebook

In your notebook insert and run a cell to install pandas and pyarrow packages:

```python
%pip install pandas pyarrow
```

Then insert a new cell to read the data. The code to use is available as part of the `M4DApplication` and can be printed with:

```bash
echo -e $(kubectl get m4dapplication my-notebook -o jsonpath={.status.dataAccessInstructions})
```

## Cleanup

When youâ€™re finished experimenting with the notebook sample, clean it up:

1. Stop `kubectl port-forward` processes (e.g., using `pkill kubectl`)
1. Delete the namespace created for this sample:
    ```bash
    kubectl delete namespace m4d-notebook-sample
    ```
