# Formatting Standards

This page shows the formatting standards for the Mesh for Data documentation.

## Use angle brackets for placeholders

Use angle brackets for placeholders in commands or code samples. Tell the reader
what the placeholder represents. For example:


1. Display information about a pod:
    ```bash
    $ kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
    ```
    Where `<pod-name>` is the name of one of your pods.

## Use **bold** to emphasize user interface elements

|Do                | Don't
|------------------|------
|Click **Fork**.   | Click "Fork".
|Select **Other**. | Select 'Other'.

## Use **bold** to emphasize important text

Use **bold** to emphasize text that is particularly important. Avoid overusing bold as it reduces its impact and readability. 

| Do | Don't | 
| - | - |
|  Examples of **bad** configurations: | Examples of **bad configurations**: |
|  The maximum length of the `name` field is **256 characters**. | **The maximum length of the `name` field is 256 characters**.  |

## Don't use capitalization for emphasis

Only use the original capitalization found in the code or configuration files
when referencing those values directly. Use back-ticks \`\` around the
referenced value to make the connection explicit. For example, use
`IsolationPolicy`, not `Isolation Policy` or `isolation policy`.

If you are not referencing values or code directly, use normal sentence
capitalization, for example, "The isolation policy configuration takes place
in a YAML file."

## Use _italics_ to emphasize new terms

|Do                                         | Don't
|-------------------------------------------|---
|A _cluster_ is a set of nodes ...          | A "cluster" is a set of nodes ...
|These components form the _control plane_. | These components form the **control plane**.

## Use `back-ticks` around file names, directories, and paths

|Do                                   | Don't
|-------------------------------------|------
|Open the `foo.yaml` file.         | Open the foo.yaml file.
|Go to the `/content/docs/architecture` directory.  | Go to the /content/docs/architecture directory.
|Open the `/data/args.yaml` file. | Open the /data/args.yaml file.

## Use `back-ticks` around inline code and commands

|Do                          | Don't
|----------------------------|------
|The `foo run` command creates a `Deployment`. | The "foo run" command creates a `Deployment`.
|For declarative management, use `foo apply`. | For declarative management, use "foo apply".

Use code-blocks for commands you intend readers to execute. Only use inline code
and commands to mention specific labels, flags, values, functions, objects,
variables, modules, or commands.

## Use `back-ticks` around object field names

|Do                                                               | Don't
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------
|Set the value of the `ports` field in the configuration file. | Set the value of the "ports" field in the configuration file.
|The value of the `rule` field is a `Rule` object.           | The value of the "rule" field is a `Rule` object.
