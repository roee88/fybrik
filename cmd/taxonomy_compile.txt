The project defines a set of immutable structural JSON schemas, e.g., for catalog and policy manager request and response. These schemas are considered part of the project API and cannot be customized directly. However, since the taxonomy is meant to be configurable, a `taxonomy.json` file is referenced from these schemas for any definition that is customizable.

This command processes a base taxonomy file and zero or more taxonomy layer files to output a `taxonomy.json` file. The base taxonomy is maintained by the project and includes all of the structural definitions that are subject to customization (e.g.: tags, actions). The taxonomy layers are maintained by users and external systems that add customizations over the base taxonomy (e.g., defining specific tags, actions).
